                        <ol>
                            <li>Hacked Clients are prohibited and will result in a 60 day ban from our UHC server if you are caught using one.
                            <li>Unapproved Modifications and Abuse of Client Side Bugs are prohibited and will result in a 30 day ban.
                            <li>Abusing Server Side Bugs can range from a 30 day ban to a permanent ban, based on severity and number of users affected.
                            <li>Using a tool to deny a playerâ€™s access to the server, such as DoSing or DDoSing, is a very serious offense that will result in a 365 day ban.
                            <li>Releasing personal information about a player without their consent will result in a 365 day ban.
                            <li>Telling a player to them kill themselves, or encouraging suicide or self harm, via any means of communication on our network will result in a 24 hour mute on the first offense, and a 7 day ban on the second offense, a 30 day ban on the third offense and a permanent ban on the fourth offense.
                            <li>Impersonation of a staff member or rank is not permitted and will result in a 30 day ban or 14 day mute depending on the context.
                            <li>Harassment and Personal Attacks are not permitted. This rule is defined by continuously attacking another person, either via text or voice, after they have asked you to stop. This includes homophobia, racism, sexism, religious talk and any other discrimination, and will result in a punishment that can range from a warning to a 7 day mute/ban, based on the severity of the offense. The distribution of adult content or content that contains adult topics will result in a 24 hour mute. This includes, but is not limited to, pornography, drugs and gore. The distribution of illegal content, such as child pornography or beastiality, will result in a permanent blacklist with no chance of appeal. Your IP address may also be forwarded to the relevant authorities.
                            <li>Charging back funds that have been sent to the network in the form of a purchase is not permitted and will result in a permanent ban from the network, and a permanent ban from the store to prevent further abuse. All payments made to the Eyslium server are considered a contribution, not a donation.
